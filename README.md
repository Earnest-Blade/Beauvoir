# Beauvoir
> 'Beauvoir' just like Simone de Beauvoir
## Overview
Beauvoir is an OpenGL-based game framework that aims to provide a simple, yet performant and flexible way to create mainly 2D games - but can still create 3D games - . I chose to create it in C to keep the code simple and flexible.

The main purpose is to create pre-rendered games using a layer system. You can either import images from Photoshop using ```.PSD``` files or stack images manually.

The framework is still in early development, but I'm doing my best to improve it!
